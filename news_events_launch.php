				<p>The Iranian Business School (IBS) Project was formally launched at a fundraising event held in London on 16 January 2009 at the Jumeirah Carlton Hotel. The event was organised and managed by ISM Management, the UK registered charity, which has been formed to undertake global fundraising in support of the Project.</p>
				<p>The evening introduced the Project and its aim of establishing a world-class business school in Iran. Addressing guests, Rouzbeh Pirouz and Roshanak Khalili-Dwyer, among the Project's founders, highlighted IBS's mission and the need for such an entity within Iran today. Joining them were Michael Hay, Professor of Management and Entrepreneurship at the London Business School, who is acting as Special Advisor to the Project, and the evening's Guest of Honour, Anousheh Ansari, the first private female and only Iranian space explorer.</p>
				<p>In support of the Project's funding needs, the evening also saw the auctioning of a special work of art from renowned Iranian artist Parviz Tanavoli, who generously donated his "Standing Heech". The auction was presided over by Edward Gibbs, Director of Islamic Art at Sotheby's, who did a remarkable job of encouraging guests to make generous bids in support of the Project.</p>
