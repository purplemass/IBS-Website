				<p>Held on the 5th of February 2010 at the Ballroom of the Dorchester Hotel in London, more than 300 business figures and individuals from within Iran and the Iranian Diaspora came to together at the Iranian Business School (IBS) Project’s second annual fundraising event.</p>
				<p>The strong attendance of business leaders and other prominent members of the community underscored the extensive support in Iran and abroad for the groundbreaking project as it moves ever closer to establishing a world-class business school in Iran.</p>
				<p>The event consisted of a dinner, raffle and exclusive auction of Iranian art and featured a prominent line of speakers and supporters of the project. They included Mr. Rouzbeh Pirouz, Chairman of the IBS Project and one of the project’s founders, President of the School’s Board of Governors, Dr. Ali Mashaheykhi, Mr. Alireza Rastegar, a member of IBS’s Founders’ Circle and Mr. Mohsen Moazami, one of the most influential Iranian-American business leaders and Vice President of Cisco Systems’ Emerging Markets and Globalisation Centre.</p>
				<p>The evening’s Keynote Speaker was Mr. Omid Kordestani one of the world’s leading and most successful business figures.  Senior Advisor to the Office of the CEO and Founders at Google, Mr. Kordestani was named as one of the "100 People Who Shape Our World" by Time Magazine in 2006.</p>
				<p>Among the highlights of the event was the auctioning of three exceptional pieces of art by renowned Iranian artists Mr. Parviz Tanavoli, Mr. Waheed Khakhdan and Mr. Mahmoud Arabshahi.  For a second year running, Mr. Edward Gibbs, Director or Islamic Art at Sotheby’s, presided over the lively auction, which saw the successful sale of all three works.</p>
				<p>Through the support shown by all of the evening’s guests and the generous bids made by those who took part in the auction, the event was a great success helping to raising meaningful funds for the Iranian Business School Project.</p>
