				<div class="text">Another Successful Fundraising Event for IBS</div>
			</div>
			<div id="body">
				<p>IBS celebrated another successful fundraising event on 4 February 2011 at the Ballroom of the Dorchester Hotel in London, which was attended by over 250 prominent business figures and individuals from Iran and the Iranian Diaspora as well as members of the global business community.</p>
				<p>The evening both highlighted the strong progress made by the Project over the past year including the first intake of executive management students as well as the strong and ever growing support the School and its vision to establish a world-class business school in Iran continues to enjoy.</p>
				<p>The event included remarks from Mr. Rouzbeh Pirouz, Chairman of the IBS Project and one of the Project's founders, and Mr. Kamran Kashani, Professor of Marketing at IMD in Switzerland, a member of IBS's Academic Planning Board, and one of the renowned teaching faculty on IBS's first executive management programme.</p>
				<p>Among the highlights of the evening were a musical performance by legendary Iranian pianist and composer, Anoushirvan Rohani, in addition to the auctioning of a number of unique works of art including those by Farideh Lashai, Reza Derakhshani, Hossein Maher, Wahed Khakdan and Wilfried Prager.  Again, for the third consecutive year, Mr. Edward Gibbs, the Head of Middle East and Indian Art at Sotheby's, presided over the auction of art as well as a number of other exciting non-art items, which were all met with great enthusiasm.</p>
				<p>Through the ongoing interest and support of IBS's volunteers, patrons and guests, the evening marked another important milestone for the Project and served to successfully raise significant funds for the School as well as build greater awareness of its important mission and the value it for Iran and the next generation of the country's business leaders and entrepreneurs.</p>
