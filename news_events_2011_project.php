				<p>Further building awareness and support among the Iranian Diaspora for a world-class business school in Tehran, the IBS team recently visited Dubai.</p>
				<p>On 23 April, a team of 11 members from the IBS teams in London and Iran traveled to Dubai to present the School to the Iranian Business Council (IBC) of Dubai and its members, which include some of the leading Iranian business professional in the emirate as well as a number of Dubai-based businesses with significant interests and commercial ties to Iran.</p>
				<p>The monthly meeting of the Council, which was attended by more than 80 of its members, provided IBS the perfect opportunity to introduce the School, its unique mission and the contribution it aims to make in the further development of the Iranian economy and the training of the next generation of managers, business leaders and entrepreneurs in Iran.</p>
				<p>Speaking on behalf of IBS were Mr. Rouzbeh Pirouz, Chairman of the IBS Project, and Dr. Zahed Sheikholeslami, Executive Dean of the School, who presented the School to IBC members and presided over a question and answer session, during which time members expressed significant interest and support for the School.</p>
				<p>IBS's participation at the IBC monthly gathering was organised by Mr. Abbas Bolurfrushan, a leading Dubai-based Iranian businessman and former Chairman of IBC. The initiative is part of a larger effort on behalf of IBS to build support and establish a presence in Dubai, through which the School intends to raise additional funds and attract partners and students.</p>
				<p>IBS has already established a Dubai fundraising team comprised of a number of volunteers including Ehsan Akhavan and Arya Bolurfrushan who are spearheading IBS's efforts in Dubai and working in coordination with IBS fundraising and events teams in London and Tehran.</p>
